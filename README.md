# Nohang

`Nohang` is a highly configurable daemon for Linux which is able to correctly prevent [out of memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory) (OOM) conditions and save [disk cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache).

## What is the problem?

OOM killer doesn't prevent OOM conditions. And OOM conditions may cause [freezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(computing)), [livelocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock), loss disk cache and killing multiple processes.

Here are the words of some users:

> "How do I prevent Linux from freezing when out of memory?
Today I (accidentally) ran some program on my Linux box that quickly used a lot of memory. My system froze, became unresponsive and thus I was unable to kill the offender.
How can I prevent this in the future? Can't it at least keep a responsive core or something running?"

> "With or without swap it still freezes before the OOM killer gets run automatically. This is really a kernel bug that should be fixed (i.e. run OOM killer earlier, before dropping all disk cache). Unfortunately kernel developers and a lot of other folk fail to see the problem. Common suggestions such as disable/enable swap, buy more RAM, run less processes, set limits etc. do not address the underlying problem that the kernel's low memory handling sucks camel's balls."

Also look at [Why are low memory conditions handled so badly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/56r4xj/why_are_low_memory_conditions_handled_so_badly/) (discussion with 480+ posts on r/linux).


## Solutions

- Use of [earlyoom](https://github.com/rfjakob/earlyoom). This is a simple and lightweight OOM preventer written in C.
- Use of [oomd](https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd). This is a userspace OOM killer for linux systems whitten in C++ and developed by Facebook.
- Use of nohang.

## Some features

- convenient configuration with a well commented config file (there are 35 parameters in the config)
- `SIGKILL` and `SIGTERM` as signals that can be sent to the victim
- `zram` support (`mem_used_total` as a trigger)
- customizable intensity of monitoring
- desktop notifications: results of preventings OOM and low memory warnings
- prefer and avoid lists via regex matching
- possibility of restarting processes via command like `systemctl restart something` if the process is selected as a victim
- look at the [config](https://github.com/hakavlad/nohang/blob/master/nohang.conf) to find more

## Demo

[Video](https://youtu.be/DefJBaKD7C8): nohang prevents OOM after the command `while true; do tail /dev/zero; done` has been executed.


### An example of output
...if command `while true; do stress -m 9 --vm-bytes 3G; done` has been executed with `rate_mem` = 9:
```
MemAvail: 2515 M, 42.8 %
MemAvail: 1510 M, 25.7 %
MemAvail:  909 M, 15.5 %
MemAvail:  520 M,  8.9 %
* MemAvailable (520 MiB, 8.9 %) < mem_min_sigterm (529 MiB, 9.0 %)
  SwapFree (0 MiB, 0.0 %) < swap_min_sigterm (0 MiB, - %)
  Preventing OOM: trying to send the SIGTERM signal to stress,
  Pid: 9828, Badness: 82, VmRSS: 485 MiB, VmSwap: 0 MiB
  Success; reaction time: 11 ms
MemAvail: 4114 M, 70.0 %
MemAvail: 2532 M, 43.1 %
MemAvail: 1495 M, 25.4 %
MemAvail:  927 M, 15.8 %
MemAvail:  553 M,  9.4 %
MemAvail:  342 M,  5.8 %
* MemAvailable (342 MiB, 5.8 %) < mem_min_sigkill (353 MiB, 6.0 %)
  SwapFree (0 MiB, 0.0 %) < swap_min_sigkill (0 MiB, - %)
  Preventing OOM: trying to send the SIGKILL signal to stress,
  Pid: 9841, Badness: 87, VmRSS: 513 MiB, VmSwap: 0 MiB
  Success; reaction time: 11 ms
MemAvail: 4084 M, 69.5 %
MemAvail: 2543 M, 43.3 %
MemAvail: 1535 M, 26.1 %
```
And demo: https://youtu.be/5d6UovJzK8k

## Requirements

- `Linux 3.14+` (because the MemAvailable parameter appeared in /proc/meminfo since kernel version 3.14) and `Python 3.4+` (compatibility with earlier versions was not tested) for basic usage
- `libnotify` (Fedora, Arch) or `libnotify-bin` (Debian, Ubuntu) for desktop notifications and `sudo` for desktop notifications as root

## Memory and CPU usage

- VmRSS is 10 â€” 13.5 MiB depending on the settings
- CPU usage depends on the level of available memory (the frequency of memory status checks increases as the amount of available memory decreases) and monitoring intensity (can be changed by user via config)

## Status

The program is unstable and some fixes are required before the first stable version will be released (need documentation, translation, review and some optimisation).

## Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hakavlad/nohang.git
cd nohang
```

## Installation and start for systemd users

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Purge

```bash
sudo ./purge.sh
```

## Command line options

```
./nohang -h
usage: nohang [-h] [-c CONFIG]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        path to the config file, default values:
                        ./nohang.conf, /etc/nohang/nohang.conf
```

## How to configure nohang

The program can be configured by editing the [config file](https://github.com/hakavlad/nohang/blob/master/nohang.conf). The configuration includes the following sections:

- Thresholds for sending signals to victims
- Intensity of monitoring (and CPU usage)
- Prevention of killing innocent victims
- Avoid and prefer victim names via regex matching
- Execute the command instead of sending the SIGTERM signal
- GUI notifications: results of preventing OOM and low memory warnings
- Self-defense and preventing slowing down the program
- Output verbosity

Just read the description of the parameters and edit the values. Please restart nohang to apply changes. Default path to the config arter installing via `./install.sh` is `/etc/nohang/nohang.conf`.
